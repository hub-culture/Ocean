# Ocean Sprint Open Data Repository 🌊

Welcome to the **Ocean Sprint** GitHub repository — an open data initiative led by the Ocean Climate Fund in collaboration with Hub Culture. This project aims to secure **open data architectures and resources** in support of a sustainable future for the world ocean.

## 🌐 Mission

We are building tools, data standards, and resources to:

- Promote transparency and data accessibility across ocean regions
- Support scientific research, policy development, and public engagement
- Foster collaboration through open contributions from global partners

## 📈 Live data

[`data/processed/qem/`](data/processed/qem/) holds the Ocean Data Initiative's latest export, refreshed every Monday by Hub Culture's QEM. It's the data behind [oceanclimatefund.com/data/OceanDataInitiative](https://oceanclimatefund.com/data/OceanDataInitiative).

- `data.json`: tide gauges, buoys and Argo floats checked against ocean models (Copernicus Marine, NOAA OISST, MUR), coral reef heat stress (NOAA Coral Reef Watch), and marine protection, ocean finance and aid for every Atlantic Rim country (Protected Planet via the World Bank, UN SDG, World Bank projects, IATI).
- `layers/`: the same as GeoJSON map layers tagged with H3 cells, for any GIS tool. `layers/layers.json` lists each layer's sources, licences and H3 resolutions.
- `manifest.json`: every file's size and SHA-256, and the last day the export covers.

Each source keeps its own licence and terms (see `layers/layers.json`). Earlier weeks are in this repo's history.

## 📁 Repository Structure

- `data/` — Raw and processed datasets with metadata and [sources.json](data/sources.json)
- `scripts/` — Ingestion, processing, and visualization tools
- `notebooks/` — Jupyter notebooks demonstrating usage
- `docs/` — Technical documentation and architecture
- `.github/` — Workflow automation and contribution templates

## 📊 Getting Started

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/hub-culture/Ocean.git
cd Ocean
```

Explore sample notebooks in `notebooks/` or start working with data in `data/`.

# scripts/ingestion/fetch_example_dataset.py

```python
import os
import requests

DATA_URL = "https://example.com/data/ocean-temperature.csv"
OUTPUT_PATH = os.path.join("data", "raw", "ocean-temperature.csv")

def fetch_data():
    os.makedirs(os.path.dirname(OUTPUT_PATH), exist_ok=True)
    print(f"Downloading data from {DATA_URL}...")
    response = requests.get(DATA_URL)
    response.raise_for_status()

    with open(OUTPUT_PATH, "wb") as f:
        f.write(response.content)

    print(f"Data saved to {OUTPUT_PATH}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    fetch_data()
```

This script fetches a remote ocean temperature dataset and stores it under `data/raw/`. You can run it with:

```bash
python scripts/ingestion/fetch_example_dataset.py
```

To fully automate this ingestion pipeline later, we can also trigger it using GitHub Actions inside `.github/workflows/data_pipeline.yml`. Let me know when you're ready to scaffold that too.
