# Ocean Sprint Open Data Repository 🌊

Welcome to the **Ocean Sprint** GitHub repository — an open data initiative led by the Ocean Climate Fund in collaboration with Hub Culture. This project aims to secure **open data architectures and resources** in support of a sustainable future for the world ocean.

## 🌐 Mission

We are building tools, data standards, and resources to:

- Promote transparency and data accessibility across ocean regions
- Support scientific research, policy development, and public engagement
- Foster collaboration through open contributions from global partners

## 📁 Repository Structure

- `data/` — Raw and processed datasets with metadata and [sources.json](data/sources.json)
- `scripts/` — Ingestion, processing, and visualization tools
- `notebooks/` — Jupyter notebooks demonstrating usage
- `docs/` — Technical documentation and architecture
- `.github/` — Workflow automation and contribution templates

## 📊 Getting Started

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/hub-culture/Ocean.git
cd Ocean
```

Explore sample notebooks in `notebooks/` or start working with data in `data/`.

## 🤝 Contributing

We welcome your contributions! Please review our [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) and [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to get started.

# scripts/ingestion/fetch_example_dataset.py

```python
import os
import requests

DATA_URL = "https://example.com/data/ocean-temperature.csv"
OUTPUT_PATH = os.path.join("data", "raw", "ocean-temperature.csv")

def fetch_data():
    os.makedirs(os.path.dirname(OUTPUT_PATH), exist_ok=True)
    print(f"Downloading data from {DATA_URL}...")
    response = requests.get(DATA_URL)
    response.raise_for_status()

    with open(OUTPUT_PATH, "wb") as f:
        f.write(response.content)

    print(f"Data saved to {OUTPUT_PATH}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    fetch_data()
```

This script fetches a remote ocean temperature dataset and stores it under `data/raw/`. You can run it with:

```bash
python scripts/ingestion/fetch_example_dataset.py
```

To fully automate this ingestion pipeline later, we can also trigger it using GitHub Actions inside `.github/workflows/data_pipeline.yml`. Let me know when you're ready to scaffold that too.
