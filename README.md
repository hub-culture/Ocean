# Ocean Sprint Open Data Repository 🌊

Welcome to the **Ocean Sprint** GitHub repository — an open data initiative led by the Ocean Climate Fund in collaboration with Hub Culture. This project aims to secure **open data architectures and resources** in support of a sustainable future for the world ocean.

## 🌐 Mission

We are building tools, data standards, and resources to:

- Promote transparency and data accessibility across ocean regions
- Support scientific research, policy development, and public engagement
- Foster collaboration through open contributions from global partners

## 📁 Repository Structure

- `data/` — Raw and processed datasets with metadata
- `scripts/` — Ingestion, processing, and visualization tools
- `notebooks/` — Jupyter notebooks demonstrating usage
- `docs/` — Technical documentation and architecture
- `.github/` — Workflow automation and contribution templates

## 📊 Getting Started

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/hub-culture/Ocean.git
cd Ocean
```

Explore sample notebooks in `notebooks/` or start working with data in `data/`.
